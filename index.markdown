Arizona Cactus Quarter Horses was formed in 2014 by Clark Sessions just outside
of Spokane, WA.

In Wyoming, the Sessions family owned the Arizona Cactus brand and itâ€™s still
going strong. We acquired some mares and went from there, building our small
ranch on quality foundation quarter horses with some bloodlines
originating in Wyoming.

Our goal is to fulfill a lifelong dream &ndash; to produce quality ranch and roping
horses with out crosses in the lines of performance, such as barrel racing.
Our focus is with the mares and choosing the right stallions that will enhance
attributes and genes from both Sire and Dame

Our bloodlines run strong, with prominent stallions such as; Blue Valentine,
Leo Hancock Hayes, Rowdy Blue Man, Zann Parr Bar, Dual Pep and Mr. Melody Jac.
We also value horses from all lines and seek out both mares and stallions of
lesser known but exceptional names like Yellow Calf, Falcon Boy, JNS Blue
Falcon, Bar Clabber and Mcit Bar to name a few.

As with any venture, we continue to learn and take it all one step at a time.
Both triumph and heartache have come our way and we are proud to continue to
hold steady for whatever the future holds here at Arizona Cactus Quarter Horses.
