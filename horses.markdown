      This colt's sire is 16hh and dame is 15.2hh. Bred to run performance, i.e.
      barrels and heading. Has been paid into Ruby Buckle incentive for his first
      year. Should make an awesome performance horse with running on top and
      foundation on the bottom. This guy is curious, meet-you-at-the-gate
      friendly and loves attention.

      This filly is put together very well. Great bone, beautiful hip, built to
      work. NFQHA and AQHA registered DNA and 5-panel N/N by parentage.
      Foundation bloodlines, that can take you in any direction. Bred for a job
      on the ranch or in the arena, or just a trip down a trail. Loves attention
      and is in your pocket looking for cookies.
