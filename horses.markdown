      This colt's sire is 16hh and dame is
      15.2hh. Bred for the best of both worlds &ndash; foundation and run. He
      has been paid into Ruby Buckle since he was a foal and is now two years
      old and ready to start. Kinicki was partially gelded and is considered
      a cryptorchid. Through no fault of his own we have reduced his price to
      reflect the costs of the surgery to remove his other testicle. He is a
      wonderful horse and would make an outstanding barrel or heading
      prospect. Kinicki is friendly, curious and loves attention.

      This filly is put together very well. Great bone, beautiful hip, built to
      work. NFQHA and AQHA registered DNA and 5-panel N/N by parentage.
      Foundation bloodlines, that can take you in any direction. Bred for a job
      on the ranch or in the arena, or just a trip down a trail. Loves attention
      and is in your pocket looking for cookies.
