# Arizona Cactus Quarter Horses

ACQH is powered by Jekyll. First time users should install it alongside `bundler`:

```sh
gem install bundler jekyll
```

With Jekyll available, install local depencies with Bundler:

```sh
cd path/to/acqh
bundle install
```

Start the site and access it at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000):

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
